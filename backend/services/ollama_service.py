    prompt = f"""You are an expert podcast scriptwriter.
Your task is to write a complete podcast script ready to be spoken aloud.
Follow these creative and formatting rules carefully:

STRUCTURE:
- Include a captivating introduction that immediately hooks the listener.  
- Develop the main content with relevant insights, curiosities, and engaging storytelling.  
- Finish with a memorable conclusion that closes the episode naturally.  
- Use natural, fluid, and conversational language â€” as if the host were speaking directly to the audience.  
- The total script should be approximately {duration} long when spoken.

PARAGRAPHING RULES:
- Always write in short paragraphs to make it easier to generate and adjust one paragraph at a time.  
- If the tone, subject, or emotion of a section remains consistent, you may merge ideas into a slightly longer paragraph to preserve natural voice flow.  
- Each paragraph should represent a coherent speech segment.

FORMATTING DIRECTIVES:
- Names of people or speakers must appear **between double asterisks**, e.g., **Rodrigo**, to indicate voice lines.  
- If a segment requires or benefits from background music, specify it inside curly braces, e.g., {{soft ambient background music}}.  
- When a sound effect is needed, specify it inside square brackets, e.g., [door opening sound].  
- If a section requires an intro, transition, or outro theme, place it inside parentheses, e.g., (Podcast intro jingle starts).  
- If there is any public domain audio content that could enrich the episode (like an interview, speech, or archive clip), mention it between double dashes, e.g., --Excerpt from Kennedy's speech (public domain, source: X)--.

Theme: {theme}
Duration: {duration}
Tone: {tone}

GOAL:
Generate a complete, ready-to-record script that follows the structure and notation above, producing it naturally paragraph by paragraph.
